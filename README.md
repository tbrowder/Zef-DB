NAME
====

**Zef::DB** - Provides Raku program 'zdb' to manage user module collections

SYNOPSIS
========

```raku
use Zef::DB;
```

DESCRIPTION
===========

**Zef::DB** can be used to test, locate, update, install, remove, and clone a user's module collection. All new data is updated into a JSON file that can be managed further by 'zdb'.

When the program is started, it expects to find one of two files that define the user's list of modules of interest.

  * localmodules.json

  * localmodules (a text file with a list of module names of interest)

The user can alternatively select another file as a start.

In either case, the result will be a JSON database. No update will be made unless the 'update' option is given.
